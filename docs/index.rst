Freshlybuiltimagebol Library
==============================

Freshlybuiltimagebol library is all about playing with images, texts and their tranlations to different languages along with generation of their corresponding audio files. 

| ``freshlybuiltimagebol = freshlybuilt + image + bol`` where **bol** is a ``Hindi`` word which in ``English`` translates to **speak**. You would notice that all of our classes and functions are named in ``Hindi``. Too much hassle? Yes, definitely, especially if you do not speak Hindi.

But the main aim of creating this library is to introduce programming to Hindi-speaking beginners who find it difficult to appraoch programming because of the language barrier.
